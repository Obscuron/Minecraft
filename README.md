Modular Kinetics
=========
Currently a work in progress mod in its very early stages.

Currently it has a very early form of a logistics network where the user can encode tags onto cards. The mod will access the encoded cards and then route items intelligently (or as intelligent as it currently is) through the logistics network.

This allows users to be able to have much more powerful sorting and item transport systems.
